            I am a photographer based in New York, specializing in landscape and architectural photography. 
            My work focuses on capturing the subtle interplay between natural and built environments.

            With over a decade of experience, I've developed a minimalist approach that emphasizes 
            composition, light, and atmosphere. My images have been featured in various publications 
            and exhibitions worldwide.
